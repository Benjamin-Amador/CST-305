Just attatch the Project 5.py script to a python project. 
Make sure that you have numpy, scipy, and matplotlib installed.
The values that are used to run the program have been hard programmed into the code.
If you wanted to change how the program functioned you would need change it inside the code.
To do this you can change the s, r, and b values or you can change the xs[0], ys[0], and zs[0] initial values.
Another thing you can change that will alter how the program functions is by changing the critical threshold limit.
To change the critical threshhold limit you will have to change the value in the if statement that represents the threshold. 
There will be comments to help find the critical threshold in the code.
