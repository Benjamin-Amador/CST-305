Just attatch the Project 8.py script to a python project. 
Make sure that you have numpy and matplotlib installed.
The values that are used to run the program have been hard programmed into the code.
If you wanted to change how the program functioned you would need change it inside the code.
There are comments added where the user can change values for ease of understanding.
To edit the inputs you will have to scroll down to line 44 in the code.
Here you will be able to change the given equation that you want to find a Riemann sum for.
You can also change the interval for the function being used in the integral.
Since we cannot set our n to infinity in practical use you can change the exact value of n for the code as well to change results.
Once you have inputted the values you want all you have to do is run the program and it will display three graphs for the user.
The graphs are the Left, Midpoint, and Right Riemann Sums.
