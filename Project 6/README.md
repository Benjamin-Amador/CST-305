FOR PART 1

Just attatch the Project 6.py script to a python project. 
Make sure that you have numpy, scipy, and matplotlib installed.
Most of the values that are used to run the program have been hard programmed into the code.
If you wanted to change how the program functioned you would need change it inside the code.
To do this you can change the values where the function is being declared.
When the user runs the code it will prompt them to enter in three values.
They will need to enter in what x is to the power of in the given equation. It will prompt the user.
For Part 1 of the project to get the desired result you will enter in 2 then 1 then 0 to get the correct answer.


FOR PART 2

Just attatch the Project 6 P2.py script to a python project. 
Make sure that you have numpy, scipy, and matplotlib installed.
Most of the values that are used to run the program have been hard programmed into the code.
If you wanted to change how the program functioned you would need change it inside the code.
