Just attatch the Project 3 script to a python project. 
Make sure that you have numpy, scipy, and matplotlib installed.
After that all you need to do is run the code.
The results will be displayed in the console and a graph will be displayed in a popup window.
You can end the program by either closing the graph or by clicking the stop button in your IDE.
